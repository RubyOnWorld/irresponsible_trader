## Why this project? ##

Ruby is a beautiful programming language and the entire Ruby ecosystem makes software development very productive and fun. However, Ruby is not widely used for statistical computing and data analysis, especially in the area of algorithmic trading. This project is my humble attempt to build a framework in Ruby for stock trading research as well as electronic trade execution in production.

## Why the name "irresponsible_trader"? ##

This project is partly inspired by the spirit of "Irresponsible Ruby", as coined by Aaron Patterson (https://speakerdeck.com/tenderlove/reddotrubyconf?slide=184) and Steve Klabnik (http://instagram.com/p/a3DLsaAASw/), which encourages Rubyists to be creative, do 'bad' things and have fun with Ruby!
